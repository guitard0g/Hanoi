# Hanoi
An exploration of the towers of hanoi problem, solving it iteratively and recursively through pattern analysis

The towers of Hanoi problem is an old classic in computer science classrooms. This is mostly due to the fact that

it can be solved with a pretty simple recursive algorithm. However the problem gets a lot more interesting when asked

to look at it iteratively.
